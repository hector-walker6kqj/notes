- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can make sure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project first, which will save you time and effort in the long run. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial when it comes to programming. You should always have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and how you plan to accomplish it. Creating a plan will ensure that your code is structured well and that all the necessary components are in place. It will also help to avoid last-minute changes and additions that can cause chaos and confusion.  
3. Stay organized: A clean and organized codebase is a joy to work with. Making sure your files, classes, functions, variables, etc. are well-named and logically organized will make it easier for you – and anyone else who needs to contribute to the code – to understand and maintain the program. Additionally, using version control systems like Git can help with collaboration and tracking changes, ensuring that everyone is working from the same stable base.
